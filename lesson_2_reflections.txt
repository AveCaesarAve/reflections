What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder ".git" is created with configuration and tracking data for my project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It will not allow to change the files anymore before commit, but will allow to have an overview on the files to be included in the commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Use command "git diff" to check how many errors were fixed or functions were added in current commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I would like to introduce some new functionalities to the code, add translations and later to introduce them to the main branch code.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They allow me to see in which point of the project structure tree am I located and see what commits are in my way to initial commit.
