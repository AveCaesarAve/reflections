What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder ".git" is created with configuration and tracking data for my project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It will not allow to change the files anymore before commit, but will allow to have an overview on the files to be included in the commit.
