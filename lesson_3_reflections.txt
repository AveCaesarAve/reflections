When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I would like to work on different machines on the same project. Also to keep a safe copy of my files on a remote server, with full commit history.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have more control over this process.
